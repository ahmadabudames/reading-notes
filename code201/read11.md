### HTML Images Syntax
The HTML <*img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.*

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <*img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.*

The <*img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.*

The <*img> tag has two required attributes:*

- src - Specifies the path to the image
- alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image

### The src Attribute

***The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.***

#### Image Size - Width and Height
**You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image.**
