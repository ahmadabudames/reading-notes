# links
***Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.***


**Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything**
**between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify**
**which page you want to link to using the href attribute.**

### mailto:

***To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified***
***email address, you use the <a> element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts***
***with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.***
