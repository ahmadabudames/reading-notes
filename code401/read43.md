# FIRST TIMERS ONLY

> **If you have never contributed to an open source project before and you’re just getting started, consider exploring these resources.**


- **First contributions** is a hands-on tutorial that walks you through contributions workflow on GitHub. When you complete the tutorial, you have made a contribution to the same project.


- **https://up-for-grabs.net** is a site that aggregates (rolls up and makes easy to explore) projects that actively want help. They label those projects with things like “up-for-grabs”, “jump-in” or “help wanted.”


- **goodfirstissues.com** is a site that aggregates the latest issues with the label “Good First Issue”, which is a GitHub feature for finding easy issues to tackle (see here). goodfirstissues.com empowers first-time contributors to find and select issues that they want to solve.


- **goodfirstissue.dev** curates easy pickings from popular open-source projects, and helps you make your first contribution to open-source.


- **CodeTriage** helps you subscribe to your favorite open-source projects and get a new open issue from them in your inbox every day.



## Get the most out of open source

**Open source software is free for you to use and explore. Get involved to perfect your craft and be part of something big.**


- **Shape the future of software:**

Your contributions help make technology better for everyone, developers and non-developers alike.

- **Work with the best in the field**:

Amazing developers use GitHub. Contribute code to projects that change how software is built.

- **Grow your skills and help others**

Whatever your skill level, working on open source software is a great way to learn new things.



## Join the community

Whether you are new to code or ready to start a big project, there are a few ways to get involved in open source.

- **Follow open source projects**

Learn how developers build and maintain open source software. You can watch a project that interests you to see its progress as it happens.


	
- **Build on great ideas**

You don’t have to build everything from scratch. Make copies of your favorite projects, experiment in private repositories, and tailor tools and features to meet your needs.


- **Contribute your skills**

Make a suggestion, fix a bug, improve documentation, or contribute code to a project. Even asking questions helps.
